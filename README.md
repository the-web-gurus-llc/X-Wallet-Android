X-Wallet is the best way to get started with bitcoin. Our simple, streamlined design is easy for beginners, yet powerful enough for experienced users.

### Fastsync
[Fastsync](https://xwallet.com/blog/fastsync-explained) is a new feature in the X-Wallet app that makes Bitcoin wallets sync in seconds, while also keeping X-Wallet technology ahead of the curve as SPV slowly phases out. When Fastsync is enabled the X wallet uses our server technology, [Blockset](https://docs.blockset.com/) to sync, send and receive instantly!

### Your Decentralized Bitcoin Wallet

Unlike other Android bitcoin wallets, **X-Wallet** users have the option to disable Fastsync converting the wallet into a standalone bitcoin client. It connects directly to the bitcoin network using [SPV](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Thin_Client_Security#Header-Only_Clients) mode, and doesn't rely on servers that can be hacked or disabled. If X-Wallet the company disappears, your private key can still be derived from the recovery phrase to recover your funds since your funds exist on the blockchain.

### Cutting-edge security

**X-Wallet** utilizes the latest Android security features to protect users from malware, browser security holes, and even physical theft. The userâ€™s private key is encrypted using the Android Keystore, inaccessible to anyone other than the user.

### Designed with New Users in Mind

Simplicity and ease-of-use is **X-Wallet**'s core design principle. A simple recovery phrase (which we call a recovery key) is all that is needed to restore the user's wallet if they ever lose or replace their device. **X-Wallet** is [deterministic](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0032.mediawiki), which means the user's balance and transaction history can be recovered just from the recovery key.

### Features

- Supports wallets for Bitcoin, Bitcoin Cash, Ethereum and ERC-20 tokens, Ripple, Hedera, Tezos
- Single recovery key is all that's needed to backup your wallet
- Private keys never leave your device and are end-to-end encrypted when using iCloud backup
- Save a memo for each transaction (off-chain)

### Bitcoin Specific Features
- Supports importing [password protected](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0038.mediawiki) paper wallets

## Development Setup

1. Clone the repo: `git clone git@github.com:xwallet/xwallet-android.git`
2. Open `xwallet-android` in [IntelliJ IDEA](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/download/) or [Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/studio)
3. Click Build > Build Project

## Advanced Setup

### Blockset Client Token

The [Blockset client token](https://blockset.com/docs/v1/tools/authentication) can be set in [gradle.properties](gradle.properties) or by using `-PBDB_CLIENT_TOKEN="<client token>"`.
A default token is available for testing.

### Firebase

To enable Firebase services like Crashlytics, add the `google-services.json` file into the `app` directory.
Without this file, runtime Firebase dependencies are still used but do not start and the Google Services gradle plugin is disabled so builds will succeed.
